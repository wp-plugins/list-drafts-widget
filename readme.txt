Outputs an unordered list of the titles of saved draft posts in a sidebar widget. The user can configure the widget title, and add a label for any untitled drafts.
 
== Description ==

List Drafts is a simple sidebar widget which outputs a list of the titles of all posts currently saved as drafts. Users can set the title of the widget, and add a label to be used for all untitled drafts.

You can now have a list of forthcoming items as a "teaser" for your readers, or as a reminder to authors that they really need to finish those posts they started. It will probably not be of interest to many people, but I like it.

== Installation ==


1. Upload the 'list-drafts' folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the widget to your sidebar in the usual way, and configure the title and description options.
